##This repo is for all my functions 

##List of functions:
### Function 1: Can be used to calculate Person-Months for grant applications. This function need the arguments: total amount of funding, tarif per hour and the total amount of hours that for a full time employee.

###Function 2: 'CountingCells' is This document is an example of a simple function in R to calculate the number of cells per ml ###in a Burker-Turk chamber. The function assumes that 2 times (2 seperate grids of the chamber) 25 squares are counted and ###takes the following arguments:

###‘Count_1’= the amount of cels counted in 25 squares in grid 1. ‘Count_2 = the amount of cels counted in 25 squares in grid 2. ###’Dilution’ = the dilution factor (e.g. for staining the cells). ‘Volume’ = the total amount of volume in which the cells are ###suspended (in milliliters).

###The output generated by the function is: ‘Cells/ml’ = number of cells per ml in the suspension counted ‘Total Cells’ = the ###total number of cells in the suspension
